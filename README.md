# Rearc Data Quest

## Table of Contents

## Description

This project resembles my attempt to solve the Rearc Data Quest. There are four parts to the quest:

1. Access data from a BLS website and load this to an S3 bucket. The data should mirror what is on the website.
2. Access data from an API and store it as a JSON file in an S3 bucket.
3. Perform data analytics on the data retrieved in steps 1 and 2.
4. Create Infrastructure as Code to automate this pipeline.

## Technology

The primary technologies for this project will by Python, Terraform, and AWS.

## Components

Additional information can be found about the various components of the project by referencing the README documentation for those areas.

## Disclaimer

Please note that AI was used during this work. The use of AI was limited to assistance with processing error messages, troubleshooting those errors, and as a more powerful search. For example, the configuration of Terraform on my computer needed to be completed in order to do this project. I utilized ChatGPT to assist me in troubleshooting access errors I was receiving during that setup. This included helping me solve the role requirements necessary in AWS in order to perform the initial builds.
